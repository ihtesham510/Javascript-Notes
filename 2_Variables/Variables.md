# ***Variables***

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
```js
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```
***The Assignment Operator***

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
```js
x = x + 5
```
In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)


**Note**

The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.




# Naming Rules

 1. Cannot be a reserved keyword.
 2. Should be meaningfull. 
      - Use Names(like : Interest_Rate) instead of Letters like (x,y,z).
      - This can prevent us having bugs in our projects.
 3. Variables cannot start with a number (1name).
 4. Cannot contain a space or a hyphen(-).
 5. Varialbles are Case-Sensitive.

# Hoisting
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

Variable and class declarations are also hoisted, so they too can be referenced before they are declared. Note that doing so can lead to unexpected errors, and is not generally recommended.
```
Note: The term hoisting is not used in any normative specification prose prior to ECMAScriptÂ® 2015 Language Specification. Hoisting was thought up as a general way of thinking about how execution contexts (specifically the creation and execution phases) work in JavaScript.
```
## Functional Hoisting
One of the advantages of hoisting is that it lets you use a function before you declare it in your code.
```js
catName("Tiger");

function catName(name) {
  console.log(`My cat's name is ${name}`);
}
/*
The result of the code above is: "My cat's name is Tiger"
*/
```
Without hoisting you would have to write the same code like this:
```js
function catName(name) {
  console.log(`My cat's name is ${name}`);
}

catName("Tiger");
/*
The result of the code above is the same: "My cat's name is Tiger"
*/
```
## Variable hoisting
Hoisting works with variables too, so you can use a variable in code before it is declared and/or initialized.

However, JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations! This means that initialization doesn't happen until the associated line of code is executed, even if the variable was originally initialized then declared, or declared and initialized in the same line.

Until that point in the execution is reached the variable has its default initialization (`undefined` for a variable declared using `var`, otherwise uninitialized).
```
Note: Conceptually variable hoisting is often presented as the interpreter "splitting variable declaration and initialization, and moving (just) the declarations to the top of the code".
```
Below are some examples showing what can happen if you use a variable before it is declared.
## `var` hoisting
Here we declare and then initialize the value of a `var` after using it. The default initialization of the `var` is `undefined`.
```js
console.log(num); // Returns 'undefined' from hoisted var declaration (not 6)
var num; // Declaration
num = 6; // Initialization
console.log(num); // Returns 6 after the line with initialization is executed.

```
The same thing happens if we declare and initialize the variable in the same line.
```js
console.log(num); // Returns 'undefined' from hoisted var declaration (not 6)
var num = 6; // Initialization and declaration.
console.log(num); // Returns 6 after the line with initialization is executed.
```
If we forget the declaration altogether (and only initialize the value) the variable isn't hoisted. Trying to read the variable before it is initialized results in a ReferenceError exception.
```js
console.log(num); // Throws ReferenceError exception - the interpreter doesn't know about `num`.
num = 6; // Initialization
```
Note however that initialization also causes declaration (if not already declared). The code snippet below will work, because even though it isn't hoisted, the variable is initialized and effectively declared before it is used.
```js
a = "Cran"; // Initialize a
b = "berry"; // Initialize b

console.log(`${a}${b}`); // 'Cranberry'
```
## `let` and `const` hoisting
Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but, unlike `var`, are not initialized with a default value. An exception will be thrown if a variable declared with `let` or `const` is read before it is initialized.
```js
console.log(num); // Throws ReferenceError exception as the variable value is uninitialized
let num = 6; // Initialization
```
Note that it is the order in which code is executed that matters, not the order in which it is written in the source file. The code will succeed provided the line that initializes the variable is executed before any line that reads it.
For information and examples see [`let` > temporal dead zone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz).

## `Class` Hoisting
Classes defined using a [class declaration](/14_Classes/Classes.md) are hoisted, which means that JavaScript has a reference to the class. However the class is not initialized by default, so any code that uses it before the line in which it is initialized is executed will throw a `ReferenceError`.  
## Function and class expression hoisting
[Function expressions](/10_Functions/Functions.md#functional-declaration) and [class expressions](/14_Classes/Classes.md#class-expressions) are not hoisted.
The expressions evaluate to a function or class (respectively). They are typically then assigned to a variable or passed to other functions. In this case, the variable declaration is hoisted and the expression is its initialization. Therefore the expressions are not evaluated until the relevant line is executed.
